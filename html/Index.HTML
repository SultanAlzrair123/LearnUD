      <br>  <p><i> <strong> Night </strong> </i> or <i>  <strong>  nighttime </strong> </i> (also spelled night-time or night time) <br> is that the amount of close darkness from sunset to sunrise throughout every 24-hour day,<br> once the Sun is below the horizon. the precise time once night begins and ends (equally true with evening)<br> depends on the placement and varies throughout the year.<br> once night is taken into account as a amount that follows evening, <br>it's sometimes thought of to start out around eight pm and to last to concerning four am. Night ends with returning of morning at sunrise.</p>

        <h5>Title description, April 10, 2019</h5> <br>
        <img src="../imges/sunrise-944x630.jpg" style="height: 300px; width: 700px;" class="img1"> <br>
        <br><p><i> <strong> sunrise </strong> </i> (or <i>  <strong> sunup </strong>   </i>) is that the moment once the higher rim of the Sun seems on the horizon within the morning.<br> The term also can discuss with the complete method of the star disk crossing the horizon and its concomitant atmospherical effects.<br>
          Although the Sun seems to "rise" from the horizon, <br>it's really the Earth's motion that causes the Sun to look.<br> The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being during a rotating reference frame.</p>

         <br><p> <i> <strong> Rain </strong> </i> is liquid water within the type of droplets that have condensed from part vapor so become significant enough to comprise gravity.<br> Rain could be a major part of the water cycle and is to blame for depositing most of the H2O on the world. <br> It provides appropriate conditions for several varieties of ecosystems, <br>moreover as water for electricity power plants and crop irrigation.

   <br>       The major reason for rain production is wet moving on three-dimensional zones of temperature and wet contrasts referred to as weather fronts.</p>
